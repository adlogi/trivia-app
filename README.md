These are bonus features that are not mandatory for this task. But even if you decide not to implement these features for this task, if you implement your code to allow future implementation of these features, that is highly encouraged (just a comment describing why you implemented your code that way is sufficent)

1. Difficulty Selection
2. Usage of Lottie Animation(https://github.com/chenqingspring/react-lottie - https://github.com/react-native-community/lottie-react-native - https://lottiefiles.com/)
3. Multiple category options on welcome page
4. 50% Joker - Disables two wrong answers (Can be used only once)
5. Timer - User has 15 seconds to answer the question, if user does not answer the question in given time, user should be directed to a page which states that time's up.
6. Point system - User earns points with respect to remaining time.
7. Host your web application's final version on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or any other similar platform if you developed a React application.
